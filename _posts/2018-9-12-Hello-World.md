title: My project experience
---

I boast a strong commitment to various academic projects that enhance my project
management capabilities. I like using R for some statistical modellings and data visualization,
while I also like Python because it enables me to better manage the data. For instance, I
worked on a final project called Data Analysis of Human Resource Optimization to analyze
the big-sample data to discover the reason for resignation. I employed two approaches, GLM
and Decision Tree, to classify the data. During the project, I encountered problems because of
the complicated data set I chose. To address the problems and empower them with statistical
significance, I consulted with my professor about dataset sorting. The project allowed me the
opportunity to work with machine learning for the first time. Even with this experience, I still
would like to learn how to research a complicated sample or provide a more accurate
recommendation. I hope that my graduate studies will enable me to excel in modeling
establishment and data analysis.
